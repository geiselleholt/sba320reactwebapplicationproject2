            Welcome to the Card Bet Challenge! You start with a balance of $100.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your goal is to increase your balance by betting on the next card
            drawn from a standard 52-card deck.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each time you draw a card, one card is removed from the deck. When
            the deck runs out, you can start a new game.
          </p>
