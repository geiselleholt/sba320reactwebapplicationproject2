### Welcome to my last Skills Based Assessment for my Per Scholas Software Development Bootcamp! This time we're focusing on everything and anything React ⚛️

### To showcase the skills I've learned, I developed a simple gambling game using the deckofcardsapi.com API. The objective of the game is to accumulate the money while betting on which card you think will be drawn next.

### The requirements for this assessment were:

✅ React Application
✅ useState (or useReducer), useEffect
✅ 3 pages - react-router-dom
✅ Access a 3rd party API and display the data on the screen
✅ Well documented ReadMe
✅ Multiple Commits. 12-15 minimum

### Tools I used:

- vite
- axios
- useCallback, useEffect, useReducer from react
- useNavigate, BrowserRouter from react-router-dom

### If I had more time I would:

- Improve CSS
- Fix bugs:
  - error messages and alerts
  - rendering / lifting of state
- Instead of messages use gifs - maybe use gify api for random gifs
- Have a high score stored in local memory
- Make it so you can bet multiple ways at the same time

### Things I struggled with:

- Choosing a 3rd party API. I wanted to use a GoogleMaps API and I spent 2 whole days planning and researching and experimenting but it got too complicated.
- Keeping it simple. I focused too much on the features when I should have focused on using more 3rd party APIs or making it look nice. There aren't any errors but the features have some bugs.

### Things I'm proud of:

- Not giving up... because I came close
- Getting so much done in one day

### Acknowledgments:

- Google / Bing / StackOverflow for looking up errors and examples
- https://deckofcardsapi.com/ for card data
- Google Maps API for driving me bananas 🍌🍌🍌 and leading me to do this awesome game last minute
