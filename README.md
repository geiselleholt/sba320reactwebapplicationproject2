### Welcome to my last Skills Based Assessment for my Per Scholas Software Development Bootcamp! This time we're focusing on everything React

### To showcase my the skills I've learned, I developed a simple gambling game using the deckofcardsapi.com API. The objective of the game is to accumulate the money while betting on which card you think will be drawn next.

### The requirements for this assessment were:
âœ… React Application
âœ… useState (or useReducer), useEffect
âœ… 3 pages  -  react-router-dom
âœ… Access a 3rd party API and display the data on the screen
Well documented ReadMe
Multiple Commits. 12-15 minimum



Stretch goals:
- Improve CSS
- Fix bugs:
- Instead of messages use gifs - maybe use gify api for random gifs
- Have a high score stored in local memory
- Make it so you can bet multiple ways at the same time
